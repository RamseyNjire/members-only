# Members Only

> Members Only is a secret clubhouse. Inside the clubhouse, members can post embarrassing posts about outsiders. When you're signed in, you can see a post as well as the person who wrote it, but from the outside, you can only read posts and wonder who might have wrote them. This app is an exercise in implementing authentication in Rails apps using Devise.
